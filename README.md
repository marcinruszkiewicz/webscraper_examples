This is a repository of example code for the [Scraping the Web with Ruby](#) article that I've written for our company blog.

This code will scrap a few pages to get you the match results of all the Alliance Tournaments from the Eve Online MMO.

To run these examples, you need the tools listed in the `Gemfile`, so you can just clone this repository and use `bundle install` to automatically get all of them.
